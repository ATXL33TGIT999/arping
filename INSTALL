arping/INSTALL

Installing, short version
-------------------------
./configure
make
make install


Installing, longer version
--------------------------
Note that arping 2.x requires libnet 1.1.x to work. It will NOT work with
libnet 1.0.x. Arping 1.x works with libnet 1.0.x, but it's not included in the
same package anymore.

Standard autotools:   ./configure && make && make install

The autotools build system is new with arping 2.09. If you have problems with
it I want to hear about it. Email me at thomas@habets.pp.se and attach
the config.log file. If it failed during 'make', give me all the output from
that.
