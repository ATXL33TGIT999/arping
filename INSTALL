arping/INSTALL

This is the short version. For more info see the README.

Dependencies
------------
libnet 1.1.x
  www.packetfactory.net/libnet
    or
  http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libn/libnet/libnet_1.1.2.1.orig.tar.gz
libpcap:
  www.tcpdump.org

For debian, just: apt-get install libpcap-dev libnet1-dev

Installing, short version
-------------------------
./configure
make
make install

If your environment is not set up right (hello Solaris), you may need
to add stuff to the configure line, like:

  ./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib -L/opt/csw/lib -R/opt/csw/lib"

Installing, longer version
--------------------------
Note that arping 2.x requires libnet 1.1.x to work. It will NOT work with
libnet 1.0.x. Arping 1.x works with libnet 1.0.x, but it's not included in the
same package anymore.

Standard autotools:   ./configure && make && make install

The autotools build system is new with arping 2.09. If you have problems with
it I want to hear about it. Email me at thomas@habets.pp.se and attach
the config.log file. If it failed during 'make', give me all the output from
that.

Examples that I use on some systems:

Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD:
  ./configure

Solaris
  ./configure LDFLAGS="-R/usr/local/lib -L/opt/csw/lib -R/opt/csw/lib" \
              CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"

IRIX (double-check this):
  ./configure  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -R/usr/local/lib"
