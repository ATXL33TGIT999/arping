 ARP Ping

    By Marvin (marvin@nss.nu)


Introduction
------------
Arping is a util to find out it a specific IP address on the LAN is 'taken'
and what MAC address owns it. Sure, you *could* just use 'ping' to find out if
it's taken and even if the computer blocks ping (and everything else) you still
get an entry in your arp cache. But what if you aren't on a routable net? Then
you're screwed. Or you use arping.

Why it's not stupid
-------------------
Say you have a block of N real ARIN-assigned IP-addresses. You want to debug
the net and you don't know which IP addresses are taken. You can't ping anyone
before you take the IP, and you can't pick an IP before you know which are
already taken. But with arping you can 'ping' the IP and if you get no
responce, the IP is availible.

Example uses
------------
If some box is dumping non-IP (like IPX) garbage and you don't know which box
it is, you can ping by MAC to get the IP and fix the problem.

If you are on someone else's net and want to 'borrow' a real IP address instead
of using one of those 10.x.x.x-addresses the dhcp hands out you probably want
to know which ones are taken, or people will get mad (a friend of mine got a
call about 15 secs after he accidentally 'stole' an IP, oops).

Compiling
---------
Improvise.

How it does it
--------------
Bah, just read the source. Or the help text.

FAQ
---
Q: after compiling arping without any problem, i test it first with
   localhost... but it doesn't respond. Isn't that strange?

A: Not really, as you can see by typing 'ifconfig' the lo (local) interface
   does not have a MAC address. It's not a physical device! MAC addresses are
   there to differentiate computers on a shared medium (the aether, or ether)
   and since packets to localhost does not go over any wire there is no need
   to identify which box is talking to which. There is only one.
---
Q: Arping find some hosts, but not others. why?   btw, I have several NICs.

A: You have to choose interface with the -i switch if the default is wrong for
   you.
---
Q: I tried to ping my own MAC addr, but it doesn't work.

A: A sane OS will think it's suspicios if you send packets to yourself over
   the wire and will ignore them.

   And why would you want to lookup the IP or MAC of yourself? ifconfig
   can tell you that.
---
Q: I can't ping any MAC address on my LAN.

A: Are they windows boxen?
   <technical>
   Arping sends arp-directed broadcast (so it does NOT go to anyone but the
   target) pings to the MAC and checks the IP address of the responding
   packet. I seem to recall windows boxen answer oddly or not at all to
   broadcast pings, but since I don't have a windows box, I haven't tested.
   I will test it, but I don't know if there is any good way around it. Sure,
   if I get a broadcast address back at least I can tell the machine is on the
   LAN but then again, the OS will probably cache the MAC so you can just run
   'arp' and see if the MAC is in there after the packet should have come back.
   </technical>
   <non-technical>
   Windows sucks
   </non-technical>
---
Q: It doesn't compile, I get some error message about libnet and/or libpcap

A: Arping depends on libnet and libpcap, get libnet at:
   http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet and libpcap from your distribution.
   (alt. you can search for libpcap on freshmeat.net)
