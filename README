Q: after compiling arping without any problem, i test it first with
   localhost... but it doesn't respond. Isn't that strange?

A: Not really, as you can see by typing 'ifconfig' the lo (local) interface
   does not have a MAC address. It's not a physical device! MAC addresses are
   there to differentiate computers on a shared medium (the aether, or ether)
   and since packets to localhost does not go over any wire there is no need
   to identify which box is talking to which. There is only one.

Q: Arping find some hosts, but not others. why?   btw, I have several NICs.

A: You have to choose interface with the -i switch if the default is wrong for
   you.

Q: I tried to ping my own MAC addr, but it doesn't work.

A: A sane OS will think it's suspicios if you send packets to yourself over
   the wire and will ignore them.

   And why would you want to lookup the IP or MAC of yourself? ifconfig
   can tell you that.

Q: I can't ping any MAC address on my LAN.

A: Are they windows boxen?
   <technical>
   Arping sends arp-directed broadcast (so it does NOT go to anyone but the
   target) pings to the MAC and checks the IP address of the responding
   packet. I seem to recall windows boxen answer oddly or not at all to
   broadcast pings, but since I don't have a windows box, I haven't tested.
   I will test it, but I don't know if there is any good way around it. Sure,
   if I get a broadcast address back at least I can tell the machine is on the
   LAN but then again, the OS will probably cache the MAC so you can just run
   'arp' and see if the MAC is in there after the packet should have come back.
